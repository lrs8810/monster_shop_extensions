# Monster Shop
BE Mod 2 Week 4/5 Group Project

## Background and Description

Monster Shop is a Ruby on Rails application. This fictitious e-commerce site allows visitors to register as a user, shop for items, add items to a cart, and place an order. In addition to a visitor and registered user, the site also supports three additional user roles including: merchant employee, merchant admin, and site admin. Each role has their own authorized access and abilities within the platform. Merchant employees and admins can fulfill orders on behalf of a merchant; site admins can ship an order and registered users are able to cancel their order before the order is packaged.

This application was built utilizing an MVC framework, CRUD functionality, and RESTful routes. Monster Shop is backed by a PostgreSQL database.
